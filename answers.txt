What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
=======
What is a remote repository?

a remote repository is what teams use to collaborate on files together. I can
make changes in my local laptop and then push those changes to the remote
repoistory so the team can make changes and also see the differences made.

the difference is that when you use rebase to merge, it rewrites the history
which makes a cleaner linear path.
